DONE

	Pass the thread number and slot id to network next via the packet (pack into two 16 byte values)

	Implement code in the next receive packet callback to unpack this data
	
	Update session table so it has a "update" method, eg. insert or keep in set if already existing.

	Extend receive packet callback so it has a void * data passed to it.

	Setup the code to swap the session table in the next thread every 60 seconds.

	Setup the code to forward packet to server from next payload receive callbacke.

TODO

	--------------

	Extend SDK5 to prefix all packets with an 8 byte session id value, after the chonkle.

	Extend SDK5 to have a force direct passthrough mode.

	Backport all changes to SDK5 to the main repo and verify that functional tests still pass.

	Backport the client ready change to SDK4.

	Backport the client ready change to the func client, to avoid heisenbugs losing the first packet.

	--------------

	Extend the proxy.cpp to enable multiple next threads.

	Implement load balancing to next threads by simply modulo'ing the packet session id by the num next threads.

	Setup two next threads by default.

	--------------

	Get the server actually initing with the server backend 5.

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy.

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Setup a relay in GCore ashburn datacenter (10G).

	Setup a client, server and proxy in GCore (10G).

	Load test in GCore.

	Work on proxy is done :)
