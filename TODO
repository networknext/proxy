DONE

	We only *really* to adjust chonkle on outgoing packets from server -> relay, because we can just disable the advanced packet filter on client and server for incoming packets.

	Where are these sent from, and what is the best place to make this change?

	It's the "send_packet_to_address" callback.

	Done. Proxy is ready for final load testing!

TODO

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy in prod w. google cloud (with advanced packet filter).

	--------------

	Setup a relay in GCore ashburn datacenter (10G).

	Setup a client, server and proxy in GCore (10G).

	Load test in GCore.
