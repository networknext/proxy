DONE

	Extend proxy.cpp to read in environment variables for configuration.

TODO

	--------------

	Setup a proxy.env that will run in google cloud, and actually init with the dev5 backend.

	--------------



























	--------------

	Add a func test for sdk5 so we don't get 100% PL reported when the client isn't upgraded.

	--------------

	Apply the same fix to sdk4. Add a func test there too.

	--------------













	--------------

	Load test that we can hit 2000 clients with the proxy actually upgrading each connected client.

	This will require some load test client MIG where we can scale out n clients per-machine, and scale up.

	--------------

	If we can't hit the 2000 clients with next active, we'll need to split up into multiple network next threads.

	This requires prefixing the network next packets with the session id, which is an extensive change. Try to avoid if possible.

	--------------

	Load test in bare metal on GCore
