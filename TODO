	Verify that we can get next sessions session going through the proxy locally.

	Clean up logs after all the changes made.

TODO

	--------------

	Extend clients.go to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend proxy.cpp to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp to print out latency, jitter and packet loss from network next client stats.

	--------------
















	--------------

	Load test that we can hit 2000 clients with the proxy actually upgrading each connected client.

	This will require some load test client MIG where we can scale out n clients per-machine, and scale up.

	--------------

	If we can't hit the 2000 clients with next active, we'll need to split up into multiple network next threads.

	This requires prefixing the network next packets with the session id, which is an extensive change. Try to avoid if possible.

	--------------

	Load test in bare metal on GCore
