DONE

	Fix the code that gets the client upgraded so it only forwards a single packet.

	Fix the bug where upgraded direct packets are not getting through on the client.

	It's caused by the packet contents being corrupted:

		client port is 2000
		client received 100 byte packet 0
		client received 100 byte packet 1
		client received 100 byte packet 2
		client received 100 byte packet 3
		client received 100 byte packet 4
		client received 100 byte packet 5
		client received 100 byte packet 6
		client received 100 byte packet 7
		client received 100 byte packet 8
		client received 100 byte packet 9
		client received 100 byte packet 10
		client received 100 byte packet 11
		client received 100 byte packet 12
		client received 100 byte packet 13
		client received 100 byte packet 14
		client received 100 byte packet 15
		client received 100 byte packet 16
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689
		client received 109 byte packet 58554496032210689

	Next thread is forwarding a 109 byte packet to the server.

	But it should only forward a naked 100 byte packet.

	Why is the payload packet containing crap at the start? Is it prefix data?	

	Fixed. The payload callback wasn't skipping past the direct packet header.

	Also applied same fix for payload callback on client to server next packets.

TODO

	--------------

	Work out how to get the server -> proxy packets funneled to network next, when a next route is available.

	It's not even upgraded, it's -- is this slot on network next right now.

	--------------























	--------------

	There will need to be adjustments made to the chonkle and pittle by the proxy, in both directions, to make sure they pass the advanced packet filter. FML.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy.

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Setup a relay in GCore ashburn datacenter (10G).

	Setup a client, server and proxy in GCore (10G).

	Load test in GCore.

	Work on proxy is done :)

	--------------

	Backport the client ready change to SDK4.

	Backport the client ready change to the func client, to avoid heisenbugs losing the first packet.
