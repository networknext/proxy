DONE

	Get the client actually upgraded.

	Clearly we need a trigger on the server side to actually upgrade the client.

	I think in this case, when we update the session, we need to know if it is a new client address or not.

	If it's a new client address, we should upgrade it.

	Got a bit of a chicken and egg going here... no packets ever go to the next thread, until it is upgraded.

	Need to work out a strategy to get the upgrade done, without creating locks and contention between threads.

	Once every ~1000 packets (assume 100 packets per-second), this would give us roughly one packet every 10 secs.

	This packet could do the upgrade, and packet loss would be very unlikely between the local sockets.

	This way we could trigger the upgrade, without making all the direct packets go through the next server.

	I think this is the way we should start now...

TODO
	
	Something wrong with the socket when trying to send to next socket. What is it?








































	--------------

	There will need to be adjustments made to the chonkle and pittle by the proxy, in both directions, to make sure they pass the advanced packet filter. FML.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy.

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Setup a relay in GCore ashburn datacenter (10G).

	Setup a client, server and proxy in GCore (10G).

	Load test in GCore.

	Work on proxy is done :)

	--------------

	Backport the client ready change to SDK4.

	Backport the client ready change to the func client, to avoid heisenbugs losing the first packet.
