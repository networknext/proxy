TODO

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp, proxy.cpp and client.go to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Test locally with the reference backend and a relay, to entice sessions to go across next.

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp to print out packets sent, packets received, packets lost, latency, jitter and packet loss from network next client stats.

	--------------
















	--------------

	Verify that we can get an accelerated session going through the proxy in dev.

	Right now it seems the blocker here is just getting a relay setup in google cloud.

	--------------

	Might be smarter to switch over to production, which should have google cloud relays setup.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy in prod w. google cloud (with advanced packet filter).

	--------------

	Load test that we can hit 2000 clients with the proxy actually upgrading each connected client.

	This will require some load test client MIG where we can scale out n clients per-machine, and scale up.

	--------------

	If we can't hit the 2000 clients with next active, we'll need to split up into multiple network next threads.

	This requires prefixing the network next packets with the session id, which is an extensive change. Try to avoid if possible.
