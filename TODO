DONE

	Run the proxy in google cloud against dev5 backend. 

	Verify it inits properly.

	Get the client, proxy and server VMs up again with latest code.

	Get the client.go connecting with a low client count and zero packet loss, to make sure everything is OK.

	Scale up client.go to 2000 clients with 1200 byte packets @ 100 packets-per-second, with 0% PL.

	Fixed service files so that proxy starts up only once the network is online.

	Now get another VM setup for next client...

	Can (just barely) get 2000 next clients working on a powerful VM.

	But I have no indication that they are accelerated or not.

	Add some logic to show (in the proxy, or the client or whatever...) that a next route is being taken.

	This way I can be confident that the load is correct, eg. actual next routes across a relay vs. direct.	

	Looks like the clients are only going direct (yes, upgraded direct but not next...)

	However, they are working next locally.

	So it's going to come down to some configuration issue for the buyer, and/or the datacenter.

	Turn on debug for the customer account and see what's up...	

	No data is coming through. Looks like debug is not working in server backend5

TODO

	Debug and fix why debug isn't showing up for server backend 5 in dev.

	----------------































	Load test in GCore, with 2000 clients direct, and 2000 clients next.

	Can we handle it? It's likely that the GCore bare metal will be much more performant than the Google cloud VMs.

	--------------

	Add a func test for sdk5 so we don't get 100% PL reported when the client isn't upgraded.

	--------------

	Apply the same fix to sdk4. Add a func test there too.
