DONE

	Move the client, proxy and server to ports that don't conflict with the reference backend.

	Test locally with the reference backend and a relay, to entice sessions to go across next.

	14.343982: debug: server received route update ack from client for session e5daa59ca029b241

	^--- Bug when client goes over next

	It seems that the client gets the route request through to the relay, but when the relay forwards the route request to the server, it is dropped with basic packet filter.

	Has the reference relay been updated to support sdk5?

	Yes. Since the sdk5 passes func tests, we know that the reference relay and the ref backend work with sdk5.

	Therefore, the only thing that can be wrong, is some offset issue with next packets when they're forwarded to the internal next thread.

	This also lines up with the bad thread number, since that is packed into the packet.

TODO

	Oh my, the next server needs to set its public address as the proxy address.

	What's happening is that relays are directly talking to the next backend sockets, without going through the proxy slots.

	Do we want this?

	One solution is to have the next server report its public address as the proxy address, that way all packets go through the proxy slots.

	Another option is to have the next server have its own distinct address, and the relays talk to that.

	Which is the best option?
































	--------------

	Extend client.go to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend proxy.cpp to read in environment variables for configuration.

	--------------

	Extend client.cpp to print out latency, jitter and packet loss from network next client stats.

	--------------
















	--------------

	Verify that we can get an accelerated session going through the proxy in dev.

	Right now it seems the blocker here is just getting a relay setup in google cloud.

	--------------

	Might be smarter to switch over to production, which should have google cloud relays setup.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy in prod w. google cloud (with advanced packet filter).

	--------------

	Load test that we can hit 2000 clients with the proxy actually upgrading each connected client.

	This will require some load test client MIG where we can scale out n clients per-machine, and scale up.

	--------------

	If we can't hit the 2000 clients with next active, we'll need to split up into multiple network next threads.

	This requires prefixing the network next packets with the session id, which is an extensive change. Try to avoid if possible.
