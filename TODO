DONE

	We only *really* to adjust chonkle on outgoing packets from server -> relay, because we can just disable the advanced packet filter on client and server for incoming packets.

	Where are these sent from, and what is the best place to make this change?

	It's the "send_packet_to_address" callback.

	Done. Proxy is ready for final load testing!

	Improve configuration via env vars, right now it is a bit too hard coded.

	At minimum by env var:

		Proxy address
		Server address
		Number of threads
		Number of slots per-thread

TODO

	--------------

	Setup the proxy so it runs as a service

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy in prod w. google cloud (with advanced packet filter).

	--------------

	Verify that we can get an accelerated session going through the proxy.
