TODO

	Make func backend 4 retry socket creation

	Backport client ready to sdk5

	Include client ready check in func tests 4

	------------

	Get the client actually upgraded.

	Clearly we need a trigger on the server side to actually upgrade the client.

	I think in this case, when we update the session, we need to know if it is a new client address or not.

	If it's a new client address, we should upgrade it.










































	--------------

	There will need to be adjustments made to the chonkle and pittle by the proxy, in both directions, to make sure they pass the advanced packet filter. FML.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy.
