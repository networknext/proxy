DONE

	Setup the proxy so it strips zero byte packets from client -> server, and adds zero byte packets from server -> client.

	Iteration time in google cloud is slow. 

	Now that we've passed load testing, switch to local development until the final load test.

	Verify that passthrough packets work locally.

	OK. I can test locally now.

TODO

	The next step is to verify that I can test a network next client connecting to the proxy, and the passthrough works.

	It should work because the client isn't getting upgraded and will only send passthrough packets.

	Implement this and verify. The client should have the same packet structure and loss detection that the client.go has.
