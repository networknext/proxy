DONE

	We only *really* to adjust chonkle on outgoing packets from server -> relay, because we can just disable the advanced packet filter on client and server for incoming packets.

	Where are these sent from, and what is the best place to make this change?

	It's the "send_packet_to_address" callback.

	Done. Proxy is ready for final load testing!

	Improve configuration via env vars, right now it is a bit too hard coded.

	At minimum by env var:

		Proxy address
		Server address
		Number of threads
		Number of slots per-thread

	Setup the proxy so it runs as a service

	Get the proxy back up to 2000 clients @ 100pps, 1200 bytes per-packet.

	Even direct to server, the client.go is losing packets... tune the kernel...

	Got client -> server direct going at 3000 clients w. tuning.

TODO
	
	Now get the proxy back at 2000 clients.

	Dig into Linux kernel tuning:

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy in prod w. google cloud (with advanced packet filter).

	--------------

	Verify that we can get an accelerated session going through the proxy.
