TODO

	--------------

	Run the proxy in google cloud against dev5 backend. 

	Verify it inits properly.

	--------------

	See how many next clients I can run vs. the proxy on a single VM (n1-standard-16)

	--------------

	Extend to 100 packets per-second and see what happens.

	--------------

	Extend to 1200 byte packets and see what happens.

	--------------































	Load test in GCore, with 2000 clients direct, and 2000 clients next.

	Can we handle it? It's likely that the GCore bare metal will be much more performant than the Google cloud VMs.

	--------------

	Add a func test for sdk5 so we don't get 100% PL reported when the client isn't upgraded.

	--------------

	Apply the same fix to sdk4. Add a func test there too.
