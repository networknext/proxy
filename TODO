DONE

	Disabled advanced packet filter in dev.

	Get the server actually initing with the server backend 5 in dev.

TODO

	Get the client actually upgraded.

	Clearly we need a trigger on the server side to actually upgrade the client.

	I think in this case, when we update the session, we need to know if it is a new client address or not.

	If it's a new client address, we should upgrade it.










































	--------------

	There will need to be adjustments made to the chonkle and pittle by the proxy, in both directions, to make sure they pass the advanced packet filter. FML.

	--------------

	Verify that network next acceleration works through the proxy.

	--------------

	Load test again in google, to make sure nothing has broken.

	Setup a relay in GCore ashburn datacenter (10G).

	Setup a client, server and proxy in GCore (10G).

	Load test in GCore.

	Work on proxy is done :)

	--------------

	Backport the client ready change to SDK4.

	Backport the client ready change to the func client, to avoid heisenbugs losing the first packet.
