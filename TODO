TODO

	Sketch out proxy.cpp

	Copy across proxy_linux.h/cpp

	Copy across proxy_macos.h/cpp

	Bring across env helpers, implement PROXY_NUM_THREADS. Default is 0, which means (on linux), one thread per-core.

	Grab relay code to work out how many cores there are from relay...

	Setup multiple threads for the proxy, with SO_REUSEPORT.

	Implement the proxy to act as a packet reflector (eg. send back to sender, initially...)

	Implement a test client client.cpp, and implement CLIENT_NUM_THREADS
