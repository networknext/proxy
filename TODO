DONE

TODO

	---------

	Implement the proxy to act as a packet reflector (eg. send packet back to sender, initially...)

	Gotta do that thing on linux to fix the socket buffer sizes etc, eg. especially do a script

	---------

	Implement env var overrides

		bind address, 

		socket buffer sizes, 

		num threads, 

		thread data bytes

	Print out config on start.

	--------

	Implement a test client so I can test throughput.

	Implement basic throughput test in google cloud. How far can I push it?

	Implement basic throughput test in bare metal.

	Integrate network next server into thread data. Will involve adjusting the SDK so that I can take over packet send/receive on behalf of server, and insert received packets directly into the SDK, and hook a callback for send packets...

	Setup client, proxy, server in google cloud and test throughput.

	Test throughput in GCore bare metal ashburn.

	Done.
