	No data is coming through. Looks like debug is not working in server backend5

	Debug and fix why debug isn't showing up for server backend 5 in dev.

	Debug why the client sessions aren't going over next.

	It was an old database.bin

	Now the route request is timing out. This means that the communication from the relay -> server is broken.

		11.469975: info: client next route (committed)
		11.469984: info: client multipath enabled
		sent 15, received 14, lost 0, max latency 0.39ms, max jitter 0.00ms, max packet loss 0.0%, next 0/1
		16.573479: error: client route request timed out
		16.573499: info: client fallback to direct

	Need to work out why this is happening.

TODO

	The next step is to add the actual route IP addresses to the debug string.

	For example:

		10.10.1.5:40000 -> 20.6.10.9:40000 -> .... -> server extern IP address

	This way we can check that the actual route being setup is correct.

	If for example, the route is being sent to the internal address of the server, this would explain it.

	-----------------------

	If the route setup is correct, we need to probably run some debug on the relay itself in google.iowa.1.

	The question is, is the relay able to communicate with the proxy next server?

	eg. add a log to the next server when it gets a "route request" from a relay.





























	----------------

	Get 1000 next sessions working for one VM.

	----------------

	Scale up multiple VMs and demonstrate 2000 next sessions working.

	----------------






























	Load test in GCore, with 2000 clients direct, and 2000 clients next.

	Can we handle it? It's likely that the GCore bare metal will be much more performant than the Google cloud VMs.

	--------------

	Add a func test for sdk5 so we don't get 100% PL reported when the client isn't upgraded.

	--------------

	Apply the same fix to sdk4. Add a func test there too.
